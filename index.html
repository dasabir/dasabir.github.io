					<p>Hi, I'm Abir Das. I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Computer Science Department at the University of Massachusetts, Lowell. My advisor is Prof. <a href="http://www.cs.uml.edu/~saenko/" target="_blank">Kate Saenko</a>. I completed my PhD in <a href="http://www.ee.ucr.edu/" target="_blank">Electrical Engineering</a> from the &nbsp;<a href="http://www.ucr.edu/"target="_blank">University of California at&nbsp;Riverside</a> (UCR). My research advisor was <a href="http://www.ee.ucr.edu/~amitrc/index.php" target="_blank">Dr. Amit Kumar Roy-Chowdhury</a> in the <a href="http://www.ee.ucr.edu/~amitrc/VisualComputingGroup.php" target="_blank">'Video Computing Group'</a> led by him. Before joinging UCR, I have done my Bachelor of Electrical Engineering from <a href="http://www.jaduniv.edu.in/" target="_blank">Jadavpur University</a>, Calcutta, India in the year 2007. Then I have worked for 3&nbsp; years with <a href="http://www.pwcglobal.com/in/eng/main/home/index.html" target="_blank">PricewaterhouseCoopers Pvt Ltd</a> (India) as a software consultant.
					</p>
					<p>My PhD research was about understanding the theory and mechanism of re-identfying a large number of people over a network of cameras with non-overlapping Fields-of-view (FOVs). Especially, I have explored what role transformation of features, consistency of re-identfication and efficient involvement of human in the process, play towards a scalable and improved person re-identification. Please visit the <a href="research.php" target="_blank">'Research'</a> page of this website to go over the research problems that I have explored during my PhD years.
					</p>
					<p>I was born and brought up in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirnahar" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Kirnahar</a>, in the district of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birbhum_district" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Birbhum</a> (Known as the "The land of red soil") of the State of west Bengal, India. Mother nature has left no stones unturned to make this little village a place of beauty. Lush green fields nurtured by the farmers cohabit peacefully with the rough and tough red soil of this region. And most importantly, the inhabitants of this place - they just make this pastoral picturesque picture perfect!!<br>
<br>
My Mom and Dad still live here. My elder brother and me go to this place whenever we can take some time off from the workplace. My elder brother is a Lecturer of Physics in <a href="http://www.apcrgc.org/" target="_blank"> Siliguri Government College</a>, India.</p>
